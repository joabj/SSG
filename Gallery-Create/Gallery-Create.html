<p>This command kicks off the Python program, Gallery-Create, that creates all the necessary links for a Gallery of photos 
on a Web page. All the photos are square, and the results are dropped in the working directory. Metadata, including working directory 
must be put in the GalleryCreateData.py page.
<p>
This is not the page for creating thumbnail directories. <b>Note: You must have full (public) write permissions on the folder
you want to write to. Don't forget to change it back after, dawg.</b>
